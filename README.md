# Dissertation Project – CNN Image Classification

## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on designing, training, and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The project follows a full machine learning pipeline, from dataset acquisition and exploratory data analysis to model optimisation and performance evaluation.
